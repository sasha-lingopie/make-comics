- Each panel clearly separated and distinct

ART STYLE:
${styleDesc}

COMPOSITION:
- Vary camera angles across panels: close-up, medium shot, wide establishing shot
- Natural visual flow: left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order
- Dynamic character poses with clear expressive acting
- Detailed backgrounds matching the scene and mood`
